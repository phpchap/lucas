                            <p>The diamond market has grown by an average of
                                15% year on year for the past 60 years and
                                coloured diamonds in particular have
                                increased in value every single year for the
                                past 100 years!  Find out why hedge funds and

                                Australia's Kimberley region will soon come to
                                an end as its rare deposits of pink diamonds
                                reach exhaustion.</p>

                            <p>The mine, which accounts for over 90% of the
                                global supply of pink diamonds, will be largely
                                depleted by 2018.</p>

                            <p>In 2010, from more than 25 million carats of
                                rough diamonds mined from the Argyle mines,
                                fewer than 10,000 carats were pink diamonds and
                                of these only 10% were over 0.20 carats. All of
                                the pink diamonds produced by the Arglye mine in
                                an average year would fit inside a single

                        <p>Owners and enthusiasts of rare gems include
                            Australian born Princess Mary of Denmark, whose
                            Shamballa bracelet has a single pavé ball
                            fashioned completely from pink diamonds, as well
                            as Queen Elizabeth II, who received the famous
                            Williamson pink diamond broach from Tanzania as
                            a gift for her wedding in 1947.</p>

                        <p>There are numerous hues and tones available to
                            satisfy every taste. Each pink stone is unique
                            and it's price is determined by its cut, colour,
                            clarity and carat.</p>

                        <p>The presence of other colours can add depth to
                            the colour of a pink diamond. Shades of brown
                            can enhance the colour of the stone, giving it a
                            "warm" pink colour. Another beautiful
                            combination is the presence of purple, giving
                            the diamond a "sweet," vibrant colour. Each pink
                            diamond in existence is the result of a rare and
                            extraordinary phenomenon and is a treasure to
                            own.</p>

                        <p>The exact reason for the pink colouration in
                            these stones has never been proved conclusively.
                            Unlike other coloured diamonds, where
                            colouration is caused by a trace element (such
                            as boron in blues), pink diamond colour may be
                            caused by internal blemishes, known as
                            graining.</p>

                        <p>The term pink as it relates to diamond grading by
                            the <a style="color:#08C"
                                   href="http://www.gia.edu/"
                                   target="_blank">GIA</a> is used to
                            describe colours in the hue range from reddish
                            purple to orange. Differences in tone give a
                            diamond its pink appearance, while saturation of
                            colour determines a colour grade.</p>

                        <p>Each pink diamond is cut from the rough in such a
                            way as to bring out the most colour saturation.
                            It is not uncommon for coloured diamonds to have
                            1-2 secondary colours in addition to their main
                            colour. In pink diamonds, the most commonly
                            occurring secondary colour modifiers include
                            purple, brown and orange.</p>

                                            yield a greater value. An I-J
                                            diamond may be sold for half the
                                            value of a D diamond. The price

                                            tend to increase 10-20% between
                                            each diamond grade.</p>

                            always how it appears mounted. In most cases,

                            reduces the chance for potentially stronger
                            colour saturation. Therefore, each diamond

                            <p>The quantity of new pink diamonds mined is
                                dwindling. Short supply, coupled with increasing
                                demand is leading to significant price
                                increases. Diamond dealers around the world are
                                increases their stock of pink diamonds in
                                anticipation of further price increases. Since
                                their incorporation into the jewellery industry
                                in the 1970s, the value of a pink diamond has
                                nearly doubled every five years.</p>

                            <p>Over the last 40 years the world economy has
                                experienced inflation, recessions, oil crises
                                and other economic factors that have influenced
                                most investment vehicles. However, a pink
                                diamond has never decreased in value and there
                                has been little consumer demand driving the
                                price up. Now that we are seeing a more
                                widespread use of these diamonds in jewellery
                                fashions, those currently purchasing a premium
                                pink diamond avoid future increases in price and
                                maximise resale profits.</p>

                            <p>In general, the most demand is for 1-2 carat pink
                                diamonds, making this size in fancy or intense
                                pink an excellent investment opportunity. If you
                                are on a budget, an alternative you may wish to
                                consider is purchasing intense or vivid pink
                                diamonds in smaller sizes (0.25-0.80
                                carats). </p>

                            <h3>Pink Diamonds as an Investment</h3>

                            <p>While each of the four C's (Cut, Colour, Clarity
                                & Carat) of Diamond grading applies to all
                                diamonds, it is very important to base purchase
                                decisions on colour first and clarity last.</p>

                            <p>Size, hue and intensity determine the ultimate
                                value of a pink diamond. While the majority of
                                all pinks have a clarity grade of SI, even I
                                clarities are often 'eye-clean,' with no
                                imperfections, or 'inclusions,' visible to the
                                naked eye. In general, pink diamonds with hues
                                closer to red have a lower clarity grading than
                                those closer to orange (Gems & Gemology, 2012).
                                Diamonds that have a strong saturation of colour
                                and a VS or higher clarity demand a premium
                                price.</p>

                                nostalgia, celebrity preference, rarity and
                                other factors. Rihanna recently sang "yellow
                                diamonds in the sky" in the song "We Found
                                Love". </p>

                            <p>At Fabergé, more customers are voicing interest
                                in the stones, says Ms. Flohr, with notable
                                demand coming from Russia, Asia—China, in
                                particular—and the U.S. </p>

                            <p>Since 2003 the price of white diamonds has risen
                                more than 30%, according to the Idex Online
                                polished diamond index, driven by demand from a
                                growing class of wealthy consumers in emerging
                                markets and interest in gems as an investment
                                vehicle. Over the same timescale, yellow
                                diamonds have increased by almost 300%.</p>

                            <p>Yellow diamonds vary greatly in price. Lighter
                                stones can sell for less than half the price of
                                top-quality colourless white diamonds, while the
                                most fiery, vivid yellow diamonds will command
                                small fortunes. </p>

                            <p>While there is no industry-recognized price list
                                or index for yellow diamonds, a round, D-grade
                                white diamond can cost around $14,000 to $15,000
                                per carat, according to Gemdax, an Antwerp-based
                                consulting firm that specializes in diamonds. A
                                similar "fancy light" yellow diamond will cost
                                around $6,500 per carat, while a more strongly
                                coloured "fancy, vivid" yellow diamond can sell
                                for more than $40,000, according to Gemdax. </p>

                            <p>As Asia's luxury boom continues, yellow diamonds
                                are likely to remain in demand. "For Asians and
                                the Chinese more specifically, yellow is a
                                really appealing colour, both for gold and for
                                diamonds," says Cindy Chao, a Taiwanese jewelry
                                designer. "It's often associated with
                                money." </p>
