                            <p>Branson-Ridley is a Trade Mark of London DE Limited</p>
                            <p>London DE Limted (LDE) acts only as an introducer (for investment products that are currently not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority) in respect of regulated activities and/or products and therefore seeks to rely on introducer exemptions in Article 33 and 33A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000/01.</p>
                            <p>LDE does not operate any form of collective investment scheme, nor can LDE offer any form of investment advice.</p>
                            <p>The purchase of our products is speculative and they are not low risk.  Purchasing our products for investment purposes is done on the higher risk speculation that there may be a maturation in the markets in the future that will allow investors to liquidate their holdings.</p>
                            <p>Whilst efforts have been made to ensure that the data and other information in this report is accurate, no warranty as such can be given and, additionally, information applicable to the market is subject to change.</p>
                            <p>LDE and/or its directors, agents or employees accept no responsibility or liability for any losses or damages incurred as a result of this report.  The content of this document and other LDE promotional, print and electronic material should not be construed as LDE (“the company”) making an offer to sell, nor an invitation to subscribe for or invest.</p>
                            <p>No representation or warranty, expressed or implied, is or will be made as to the accuracy or completeness of the information, including all projections or opinions expressed in the text and no liability is accepted by the company and/ or its directors, agents or employees.  By accepting delivery of the content the recipient agrees not to reproduce and/or distribute this in whole or in part.</p>
                            <p>Recipients of this information are advised to consult their own financial advisors and consider for themselves the financial, legal and other consequences of any purchase before doing so.  The Financial Conduct Authority does not regulate LDE and recipients are reminded of the risk factors described in the content and in our Terms of Business.</p>
                            <p>Trading on over-the-counter markets requires experience, knowledge and skill.  You may lose some or all of your investment.  Liquidity in the water rights market is still low, meaning you may lose money on your investment by not getting a competitive rate when trading small volumes or you may not being able to sell your investment at all.  Although liquidity in the diamond market is good, as there is no formal exchange the spread between your buying and selling price may differ.</p>
